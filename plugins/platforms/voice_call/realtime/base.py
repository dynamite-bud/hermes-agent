"""Realtime voice session abstraction.

Hermes has no first-class realtime voice provider registry, so the
voice_call plugin carries its own (modeled on ``plugins/google_meet/
realtime`` but asyncio-native): a :class:`RealtimeVoiceSession` is one live
speech-to-speech connection — caller PCM in, model PCM out, plus
transcripts, barge-in signals, and tool calls.
